    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <h3>I consider myself fortunate to be able to say I love my job.</h3>
    <p>‘Work’ for me is satisfying my curiosity; exploring every corner of the web. Whilst I enjoy developing with many different web technologies, my real passion is building beautiful, usable and high performance front-end interfaces.</p>
    <h3>'Rockstars' are great but collaboration is really where it's at.</h3>
    <p>In my career, I have worked with some of the world’s most prestigious brands as well as some of the most highly regarded agencies. The key to success in the web industry is creating a culture of collaboration and acceptance of ideas and opinions without fear of judgement. These just so happen to be central tenets of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic" target="_blank">hacker ethic</a>. Fostering an environment where my team pools their knowledge to come up with the best solution - that's what motivates me.</p>
    <h3>We always fear what we don't understand.</h3>
    <p>All that we are is simply a collection of our own individual experiences. What I find normal may be unacceptable to others. What my culture accepts as truth may be questioned by another.</p>
    <p>I always aim to put myself in other peoples' shoes when viewing a situation. What makes them see this in a different way from me? How can we solve this so we both get what we want?</p>
    <p>To understand others, you have to go and see the world through their eyes. For this reason, a primary goal of my life is to visit and experience as many countries and cultures as possible. Because when I can see the world through another's eyes, there's no longer any need to be afraid of what I see looking back at me.</p>
